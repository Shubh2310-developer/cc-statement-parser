```

**What it does:**
- Shows if backend is running (PID, port status)
- Shows if frontend is running (PID, port status)
- Checks API health endpoint

## Directory Structure

After running the scripts, the following directories are created:

```
cc-statement-parser/
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/               # Log files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend.log
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frontend.log
â”œâ”€â”€ pids/               # Process ID files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend.pid
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frontend.pid
â””â”€â”€ scripts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ start-all.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ stop-all.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ restart-all.sh
    â””â”€â”€ status.sh
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start everything
./scripts/start-all.sh

# Check status
./scripts/status.sh

# View logs
tail -f logs/backend.log
tail -f logs/frontend.log

# Stop everything
./scripts/stop-all.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you get an error that a port is already in use:

```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8000  # for backend
lsof -i :5173  # for frontend

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use stop-all.sh which handles this
./scripts/stop-all.sh
```

### Services Won't Start

1. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   cat logs/backend.log
   cat logs/frontend.log
   ```

2. Make sure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Restart services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/restart-all.sh
   ```

### Database Issues

If the database isn't initialized:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -c "
import asyncio
from app.database.connection import init_db
asyncio.run(init_db())
"
```

## Development

### Logs Location

All logs are stored in `logs/`:
- `backend.log` - Backend API logs
- `frontend.log` - Frontend dev server logs

### PID Files

Process IDs are stored in `pids/`:
- `backend.pid` - Backend server process ID
- `frontend.pid` - Frontend server process ID

These files are used to track running services and should not be edited manually.
